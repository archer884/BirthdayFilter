BirthdayFilter
==============

We've all been there--you get to school and you're all excited because the teacher gave the kid next to you a lollipop on her birthday. Then you do the awful, awful calculus and you realize that, no, you're not going to get a lollipop -- *ever* -- because your birthday is in July and school lets out sometime in May.

Sorry, Charlie.

This program is for you. It's suppose to help your evil, evil third grade teacher figure out the best way to dole out candy year-round so that no one gets slighted. Because you remember that one chump teacher in *fourth* grade who swore to goat that everyone was going to get candy, dammit, and who then promptly forgot to hook up anyone with a surprise mid-school-year birthday until May 17th, at which point every kid got one lollipop and the equivalent of about one twentieth of a Happy Birthday Song (divided evenly among twenty brats, you see).

He tried. He failed.

Your job is to help see that he never fails again.
